# Extension-Juggler
File upload extension juggler, prints a list containg extension upload bypasses ex .php8\x00.mp3, .php7%00.gif, .php.jpeg or .php.jpg%00 etc. At the moment only supports PHP but all you need to is change to the extensions you need in
the php_extensions array and same with the suffix extensions if you want to swap/add those.
